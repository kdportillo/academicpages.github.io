I am currently an undergraduate at the University of Houston studying Computer Science. I was born in Galveston, TX but have spent most of my life in the Houston suburbs. My interests include photography, live sound, studio recording, Computer Networks, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Internet of Things.
